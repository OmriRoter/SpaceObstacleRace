## Space Obstacle Race Game

Welcome to the **Space Obstacle Race Game** repository! This is my first Android app developed, a fun and engaging endless runner game. Navigate your spaceship through an endless array of obstacles in space, dodging asteroids and collecting points along the way. The game includes intuitive controls, vibrant graphics, and a dynamic scoring system to keep you entertained for hours.

## Features

- **Endless Gameplay:** The game continues as long as you have lives left, providing endless fun.
- **Dynamic Scoring:** Your score accumulates throughout all attempts, even after losing lives, so you can always aim for a higher score.
- **Simple Controls:** Easily move your spaceship left or right using arrow buttons on the screen.
- **Pause Functionality:** Pause and resume the game at any time without losing your progress.
- **Collision Detection:** Real-time collision detection with asteroids to make the gameplay challenging.
- **Lives System:** You start with 3 lives, and each collision with an asteroid reduces a life. The game ends when all lives are lost.
